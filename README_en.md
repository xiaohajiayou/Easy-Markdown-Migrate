**Easy Markdown Migrate** is a plugin designed for migrating `Markdown` files, binding files with the images linked within them, and helping users easily move, delete, copy, and paste files or content, making local management and image hosting backups simpler. 


Project Overview
---------------
With this plugin, users can focus on writing documents, and the plugin will automatically recognize image links in the files and match them with the corresponding images, allowing for quick sorting of files and images within the same directory.With just a simple click on the menu options `Migrate File` or `Copy Select Content`, `Paste Select Content`, you can migrate files and images to the desired location, achieving seamless migration of files and images, greatly improving the efficiency of document management.


In addition, Easy Markdown Migrate also provides functions such as image hosting upload, image download, image move, and image delete. These features can help developers who are used to local management to publish blog image hosting version backups; it can also facilitate developers who prefer image hosting management to download remote images to local for maintenance and local backup. These operations automatically maintain the relationship between images and files, ensuring the correctness of image links.

Our goal is to make `Markdown` document management not only efficient but also user-friendly. Even beginners who have never used `Markdown` can simply create an `./images` folder in the root directory to store all images and use the plugin's features to achieve reliable migration management.
